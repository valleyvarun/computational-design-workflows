  <!-- Section for first p5.js sketch (2d-drawing.js) -->
  <div class="section-title">Lorenz Attractor</div>
  <p>This canvas plots three Lorenz trajectories in red, green, and blue using the P5.js library, each beginning from a slightly different point. Even these tiny differences in their initial states lead to completely divergent outcomes—a defining feature of chaos theory, which studies complex systems that are highly sensitive to their starting conditions. Commonly known as the Butterfly Effect, this phenomenon appears throughout nature, from weather systems, ocean turbulence, and smoke patterns to the motion of celestial bodies and biological processes such as heartbeat irregularities and the spread of disease.</p>

  <div class="section-title">NPN Transistor: Silicon Lattice</div>
  <p>This canvas simulates doping of semiconductors and the movement of free electrons and 'holes'. </p>
  <p>The NPN wafer forms the core of a typical transistor, the fundamental building block of computation. It is made from silicon that is lightly doped with other elements to increase its conductivity. Doping with elements like phosphorus adds extra free electrons, creating n-type silicon, while doping with elements such as boron creates electron deficiencies or “holes,” producing p-type silicon.</p>
  <p>Let’s dope the silicon wafer! Drag the dopant atoms onto the wafer and place them in the correct positions to create extra free electrons or holes.</p>
